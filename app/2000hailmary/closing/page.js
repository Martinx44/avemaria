          Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known, that anyone who fled to Your protection, implore Your help or sought Your intercession, was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, I fly unto You, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother!
          To You I come, before You I stand sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petition, but in Your mercy, hear and answer them. AMEN.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
          ALL: Prostrated at Thy feet, and humiliated by my sins, but full of confidence in Thee O Mary! I beg Thee to accept the petition my heart is going to make. It is for my last moments. Dear Mother, I wish to request Thy protection and maternal love so that in the decisive instant, Thou wilt do all Thy love can suggest in my behalf.  To Thee, O Mother of my soul, I consecrate the last two hours of my life. Come to my side to receive my last breath and when death has cut the thread of my days, tell Jesus, presenting to Him my soul, 'I love it.' That word alone will be enough to procure for me the benediction of my God and happiness of seeing Thee for all eternity. I put my trust in Thee, my Mother, and hope it will not be in vain. O Mary, pray for Thy children and lead them to Jesus. Amen.

          Accept, O Mother of Christ, this cry laden with the sufferings of all individual human beings, laden with the sufferings of whole societies. Help us with the power of the Holy Spirit to conquer all sin: individual sin and the 'sin of the world', sin in all its manifestations. Let it be revealed once more in the history of the world, the infinite saving power of redemption: the power of merciful love. May it put a stop to evil.
          May it transform consciences. May your Immaculate Heart, reveal for all, the light of hope. Amen.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
          O Loving Father, as intercessors, we have taken upon us the burdens and grief of Your people, but we know that you do not want these burdens and grief to remain in us. We, therefore, bring all these to Your throne of grace, where You will dispose of them according to Your wonderful and divine plan. Wash us clean of all these burdens, with the Blood of the Lamb. Lighten our hearts and fill us with Your Love, Peace and Joy.
Almighty Father, we now ask You to soak us with the Holy Blood of Jesus to cleanse us from any burden and any unclean spirit that might have clung to us as intercessors. In Jesus' Name, we bind them all at the foot of the cross until You, O Lord Jesus, tells it where to go.
Amen.
