      <section className='mb-8'>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          Praying 2,000 Hail Marys is a private devotion. It is a very powerful intercessory prayer. It is Praying 2,000 Hail Marys with our Blessed Mother to our Lord Jesus Christ. Combined with Your faith and sincerity of heart, there are 3 graces or intentions which our Mother Mary will intercede for you and grant you.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          Opening Prayer or Song - 'Come Holy Ghost' invoke the Holy Spirit and pray that He gives You the gift of fortitude - so that you may have the grace to finish the length or duration of praying the 2,000 Hail Marys. Pray for the gift of piety so that you can pray with your heart.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          Offer every word that you say, let it be a prayer that rise up to God, to glorify, praise and to thank Him; to ask forgiveness for our sins, and to ask Him for His blessings and for whatever your intentions may be. Uplift everything to the Lord. Open and lift your heart and your mind, so that the Holy Spirit will come and outpour His spirit on you and possess you.
        </p>

          Surrender yourself FULLY to our Lord Jesus Christ as we pray with our Mother Mary. She will intercede for us to Her son, Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          You begin by praying the 20 Mysteries - Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious and Luminous. Holy Mass follows if a priest is available at the time.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          Start the 2,000 Hail Marys. We have 20 general petitions. Every petition is read before each 100 Hail Marys. If you are in a group, designate that each person will take turn to lead the prayer of a round of Hail Marys. One complete round of the rosary is 100 Hail Marys. You will need to pray 20 rounds to complete the 2,000 Hail Marys. It may take about 8 1/2 hours to complete the 2,000 Hail Marys.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          At 3:00PM, we pray the 3 o'clock prayer and pause silently to implore our Lord's mercy, especially for sinners and meditate on His passion in this hour of great mercy. Our Lord said, 'In this hour, I will refuse nothing to the soul that makes a request of Me in virtue of My Passion.' The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy is prayed and the 2,000 Hail Marys continues until finished, interrupted at 6:00PM by praying 'The Angelus.'

        <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>AN IMPORTANT REMINDER</h2>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          Let us go down on our knees before we start praying the 2,000 Hail Marys and let us visualize that our Lord and our Lady stand and are truly present before us, waiting for us to pray as if everything depends on our prayer. With that in mind, let us observe 'SILENCE' all throughout the prayer, refrain from unnecessary talking, and concentrate on praying with our whole mind, body and soul.

        <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold mb-4'>THE DEVOTION OF THE TWO THOUSAND HAIL MARYS</h2>
        <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>MONSIGNOR JUAN RIO</h3>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          It was March 1933 and I was studying in the Salesian Seminary of Barcelona, Spain. At that time, I was only fifteen and a half years old.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          One day, close to March 25, 1933, a companion at the seminary called Daniel Ara, told me: 'Riu, I have something interesting to let you know: There is a pious belief assuring ANY GRACE to be asked from Our Lady Virgin Mary, to whom he says TWO THOUSAND HAIL MARYS on March 25, the Feast of the Annunciation of the Angel to the Virgin Mary.
        </p>
        <p>
          That message remained deep in my mind, and when March 25 arrived, I recited with great devotion the TWO THOUSAND HAIL MARYS asking OUR LADY THREE GRACES: TO BECOME A SALESIAN, PRIEST AND MISSIONARY...and then, I waited trustfully that Our Lady should fulfill Her promise.
          On July 27, 1935, I made the vows as a SALESIAN: The FIRST GRACE was granted.
          On June 15, 1946, I was ordained PRIEST by Bishop Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, in Madrid, Spain and the SECOND GRACE was granted.
          On August 30, 1952, I landed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and I started my missionary apostolate in the poorest slum, and the THIRD GRACE has been fulfilled....After twelve years, I was invited to become a missionary in the Salesian Missions of Ecuador, S.A. until today....
          During my forty-five years as a priest, I have been promoting the devotion of the TWO THOUSAND HAIL MARYS with great success, as well as many people have done the same devotion....and they have received the graces requested, some instantly, and others, later.
          Today, close to March 25, 1992, I'm doing a kind invitation to all, to say TWO THOUSAND HAIL MARYS to Our Lady the Most Pure Mother of Our Lord, asking HER any kind of graces, in the trust SHE will grant them through Her Powerful Intercession.
