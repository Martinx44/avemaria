          <p>You died Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fountain of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.</p>
          <p>O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fountain of mercy for us, I trust in You (3x)</p>

          <p>Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your dearly beloved Son, Our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world</p>
          <p>On the 10 Small Beads of Each Decade:</p>

          <p>Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion - inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments, we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your Holy Will, which is Love and Mercy itself. Jesus, I trust in You. (3x) St. Faustina, pray for us.</p>
          <p className='text-xl'>CONSECRATION TO THE DIVINE MERCY          </p>
          <p>O Great and Merciful God, Infinite Goodness, today I offer myself to Your Divine Mercy and to Your most Holy Will, which is Love and Mercy itself. With all mankind, I cry out to You from the depth of my misery to Your Mercy - to Your compassion, O God; and it is with a mighty voice of misery that I cry out. Gracious God, do not reject the prayers of this earth's exile, but from the depths of Your Mercy, accept this simple act of love and union with You.
          O Lord, Goodness beyond all understanding, Who is acquainted with my misery, through and through, You know that without Your Divine Power, I cannot ascend to You. I implore You, fill me with Your grace, and keep on increasing Your Mercy in me, that I may faithfully do Your Holy Will all through my life, and at the hour of my death. Through this gift of myself to You, shield me from the attacks of my salvation's enemy, so that I may await Your final coming with confidence, that day which You alone know and in which ! hope to be totally Yours. By this CONSECRATION, I pray to obtain all that Jesus has promised, despite my wretchedness, for Jesus is my hope. Through His Merciful Heart, as through an open gate, I shall pass into the bliss of Heaven. May my acts of mercy gain for me and all I love, a communion of joy with You for all ETERNITY, for You live as one God, forever and ever.</p>
