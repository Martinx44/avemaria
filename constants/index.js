      description:
        "LEADER: It is our dialogue and communion with GOD. Teach us how to cultivate and experience the power of prayer in ourselves. Give us the grace to pray in every opportunity we have, and uplift every task that we do, as a prayer, which we offer to Jesus. Let us remember what our Mother Mary said, 'that GOD has chosen to use us in His great plan of salvation for mankind.' So let us not be wrapped up in just praying for ourselves, but for mankind, particularly for the conversion of those who are not now in God's grace. AMEN.",

      description:
        "LEADER: Let peace begin within us and from us, within every person, so that we can, in turn, spread peace in the world to all mankind and peace between us. Heal us of our fault: and weaknesses and let us realize that if we want to be cleansed and be healed, we must first have total forgiveness and love in our hearts. Let us not dwell in things that are not of God, like anger, pride, envy and selfishness. But instead, pour in our hearts, through the Holy Spirit, the gift of love, humility, patience, forgiveness and understanding. It is only through dying to one's 'self' that we can truly have peace.

And killing the unborn is a grievous, mortal offense against God, the Creator of Life. Let your grace fall upon all people so that they will respect, defend, and uphold the sanctity of life, not only of the unborn, but of the aged, the dying, the handicapped, and the unwanted as well. Also, let the confused, who are on the verge of committing suicide very carefully weigh in their minds God's 5th commandment, 'THOU SHALT NOT KILL,' and avoid this serious sin against God. AMEN.",
